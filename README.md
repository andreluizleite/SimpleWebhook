For building a simple webhook .NET application to process payments in a queue, you can use the following technologies and tools:

ASP.NET Core Web API:
Use ASP.NET Core Web API to build the webhook receiver application. ASP.NET Core Web API is a lightweight and high-performance framework for building APIs, making it a great choice for handling incoming webhook requests.

Azure Queue Storage:
Azure Queue Storage is a simple and cost-effective queuing service provided by Azure. It allows you to store and retrieve messages in a queue for asynchronous processing. In your webhook application, you can store payment-related data in an Azure queue when a payment event is received.

Azure Functions (optional):
If you want to process the payments asynchronously and scale automatically based on the workload, you can use Azure Functions with the Azure Queue Storage trigger. Azure Functions can process messages from the queue and execute payment processing logic.

Entity Framework Core (optional):
If you need to persist payment data or manage a database for payment processing, you can use Entity Framework Core for database operations. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for working with databases in your .NET application.

Here's an overview of how these technologies fit together in your webhook application:

Webhook Receiver (ASP.NET Core Web API):

Implement an ASP.NET Core Web API with an endpoint to receive webhook notifications from the payment service. Parse the incoming data and store it in an Azure Queue for further processing.
Queue Storage (Azure Queue Storage):

Create an Azure Queue Storage account and a queue to store the payment data received from the webhook. When the webhook receives a payment event, enqueue the payment data into the Azure queue.
Payment Processing (Azure Functions - optional):

Create an Azure Function with a Queue Storage trigger that listens for new messages in the queue. When a new payment message arrives in the queue, process the payment asynchronously.
Data Persistence (Entity Framework Core - optional):

If required, use Entity Framework Core to persist payment-related data to a database. For example, you might want to store payment details, transaction status, or customer information.
Logging and Monitoring:

Implement logging and monitoring to track the status of webhook events, payment processing, and any potential errors that may occur.
By using these technologies, you can build a scalable and efficient webhook .NET application to process payments in a queue. Additionally, Azure services like Queue Storage and Functions will handle the scaling and availability aspects, allowing you to focus on your payment processing logic.
